The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler

calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The

yescrypt, gost-yescrypt, scrypt, bcrypt, sha512crypt, sha256crypt,
md5crypt, SunMD5, sha1crypt, NT, bsdicrypt, bigcrypt, and descrypt.

crypt_ra, crypt_gensalt, crypt_gensalt_rn, and crypt_gensalt_ra.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human. It is not suitable
for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any other situation
where speed is more important than careful handling of sensitive data.
